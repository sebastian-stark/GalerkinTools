This is the documentation of the Galerkin\+Tools library. The main purpose of the library is to help with the assembly of finite element systems for formulations obtained based on the Galerkin approach. Though the library must of course make certain restrictions on the class of problems for which it can be applied, it is believed to be useful for the solution of many practical problems especially in the field of solid mechanics. Special focus of the library is on problems involving different domain portions (e.\+g. different materials) as well as on problems involving unknown fields living on interfaces or boundaries.

Further information on the main concepts can be found in the pdf document \href{../notes/galerkin_tools.pdf}{\texttt{ galerkin\+\_\+tools.\+pdf}}.
